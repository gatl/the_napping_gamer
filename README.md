A script that helps people get some sleep during GOG Insomnia Sales

GOG Insomnia Sales make one or two games available in limited quantities. When one of the pools exhausted, a new game is made available in its place. Thus, the conscious gamer needs to keep an eye on the website so that a good opportunity does not pass by.

This script monitors the GOG promo sale for you, and lets you know when a new game comes up! That way you can finally catch some ZZZ or, optionally, actually do something productive during the sale.

It also tries to predict how long the current games on sale will stay up, so that you can better organize your time away from the keyboard while a game is keaning (dragging down the sale).
